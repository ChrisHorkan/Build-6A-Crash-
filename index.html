          <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <p class="lead"><b>Major and fatal car crashes occur frequently every day across the United States.</b></p>
          
          <p>Speeding and reckless driving is not a new issue to Hartford: as the data in Ed Stannard's <a href='https://www.courant.com/2022/07/18/here-are-10-hartford-roads-with-the-most-crashes-since-2020-with-a-map-that-shows-worst-spots/'>article</a> finds that from January 2020 to July 2022, there were 614 crashes in 10 specified Hartford corridors, including 6 fatalities.<p> 
          <p>The article states reasons for crashes that are not unique to Hartford like, "... human error, distracted drivers and non-motorists, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, speeding 'and otherwise just not following the rules of the road (running stop signs, driving aggressively, not yielding to pedestrians or right-of way traffic, etc.),'” to explain why Hartford has seen so many crashes in such a short period of time (Stannard, Ed 4).<p>  
          
          <p>To Trinity students, this issue is important on a personal level because just last Spring a student died from reckless driving along a Hartford corridor.</p>
          
          <p>This type of danger should not be in the minds of Trinity students or any one else in Hartford. This is why it is important to find the most dangerous Hartford corridors to eventually find solutions to remedy the danger they pose.</p>
          
          <p class="lead"><b>What is a <i>corridor</i></b>?</p>
            
            <p>Simply put, a corridor is street, road, or avenue. In order to quantify the danger found in Hartford corridors, we had to view databases that contain Hartford crash data. The most helpful one we found was 2018-2022 Hartford police report crash data from the <a href='https://www.ctcrash.uconn.edu/'>UCONN Crash Data Repository</a>. Our data and subsequent visualization and interpretation is based on crashes taking place on their respective road, and other associated data like conditions and injury type.
              
              <p>It is worth noting that we did not include any non-local corridors such as interstates and intersections in our data. This is because interstate issues are not something that the city of Hartford has a large influence in. Meanwhile, intersection crash information has different solutions than corridor crash solutions and requires a different view point. Either way, the inclusion of interstates and intersections would likely skew our results.</p>

          <h2>Crashes on Hartford Corridors and Normalizing by Length</h2>
           <p class="lead"><b>So... which Hartford corridor has the most crashes?</b></p>
          <p><ins>It's Main street</ins>.</p>
          
          <p>As seen in Figure 1, Main Street in Hartford has the most crashes out of any street with 1,151.</p>

         <iframe title="Total Crashes on Hartford Corridors" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-66ize" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/66ize/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="590" data-external="1"></iframe></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

        <p><b>Figure 1</b>: <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/66ize/">This chart</a> shows that Main Street has the highest number of crashes out of Hartford corridors with 1,151</p>
          
        <p class="lead"><b>But is Main street the most dangerous?</b></p>
          
          <p>To answer that question we need to put our data into context.</p>
        <p>You might expect a street called <i>Main street</i> to be an important and long street. And in Hartford's case, you're right.<p> 
        <p>In order to adjust for this, we must <i><b><ins>normalize</ins></b></i> the data by corridor length (in miles). By normalizing the data, we mean to take the data and “adjust raw counts into relative rates, such as percentages or per capita," but in this case relative to <b>length</b> (<a href='https://handsondataviz.org/normalize.html'>Hands-On Data Visualization, Chapter 5: Normalize the Data</a>).

          
          <p>As we build our model throughout this study, we must acknowledge that "It’s unrealistic to pretend that we can create a perfect model. But we can certainly come up with a <i>good enough one</i>" (<a href='https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Truthful_Art/8dKKCwAAQBAJ'>Alberto Cairo, 2016</a>).</p>
          
          <p>Once we normalize our corridors for length, something is immediately apparent:</p>
        <p> As shown in Figure 2, <b>Park Street</b> has the most crashes per mile.</p>
          
          <iframe title="Park St. Has Most Crashes Per Mile in Hartford" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-AQ7R4" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AQ7R4/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="590" data-external="1"></iframe>

          </script>
        
<p><b>Figure 2</b>: <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/AQ7R4/"> This chart</a> shows that Park Street has the highest number of crashes per mile with 368.</p>

          <h2>Types of Injury on Hartford Corridors</h2>
          <p class="lead">Which Hartford corridors create the most injuries, and by what type?</p>
          
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, the makeup of injury types in Hartford corridors look somewhat uniform:</p>
          
           <iframe title="Percentages of Injury Type in Crashes on Hartford Corridors" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-YaAYj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YaAYj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="601" data-external="1"></iframe></iframe>

          </script>
        
<p><b>Figure 3</b>: <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/YaAYj/"> This chart</a> shows that injury makeup percentages caused on Hartford crashes are somewhat similar.</p>

<p>However, the leading corridors that cause each type of injury are:</p>
<p><b>Possible</b>: <i>New Park Ave</i> (67%; 32 total)</p>
<p><b>Suspected Minor</b>: <i>Farmington Ave and Granby Street</i> (54%; 59 and 13 total, respectively)</p>
<p><b>Suspected Serious</b>: <i>Tower Ave</i> (11%; 8 total)</p>
<p><b>Fatal</b>: <i>Tower Ave</i> (2.7%; 2 total)</p>

<p>Main Street and Park Street, the leaders in total crashes and crashes per mile respectively, are not leaders in an injury type. Yet, Tower Ave leads both categories of Suspected Serious and Fatal Injuries.</p>

<p>With our insights, we can ask questions like, "is there something inherent about Tower Ave that causes more dangerous injuries in car crashes?"</p>
<p>This is definitely a question worth asking because although <i>many</i> crashes occur on the longer streets, these streets may be much harder to prevent dangerous crashes on due to their seemingly "<i>normal</i>" injury correlation.</p>
  
  <p>However, when there is an apparent anomaly of the serious injuries and deaths occuring on Tower Ave, we are in a position to find out why.</p>

          <h2>What Is Causing These Injuries?</h2>
          
          <p>It was mentioned earlier that the data used in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/66ize/">Figure 1</a>, <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/AQ7R4/"> Figure 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/YaAYj/"> Figure 3</a>  was taken from 2018-2022 Hartford police report crash data from the UCONN Crash Data Repository. This is noteworthy because if we look into the data further, we can find the reasons why our data and visualizations turned out the way that it did and get to the bottom of these car crash injuries.</p>
      
      <p class="lead"><b>The COVID-19 Pandemic</i></b></p>
      
      <p>First and foremost, it is important to mention the effect that COVID had on the Hartford community. From the middle of March, about March 15, 2020 when government lockdowns were mandatory, there were 5,528 crashes reported in 2020, 5,448 crashes reported in 2021, and 5,294 crashes reported in 2022. This is a sharp decline from the crashes reported in 2019 at 6,178.<p>

      <p>Since more people were staying inside because of the government enforced lockdowns, it should come as no surprise that there were less crashes reported. However, this does skew our data as we will never know if the number of crashes had decreased because of increased safety measures by the city planners or because the lockdowns forced people to drive when it was only necessary.<p>
      
      <p class="lead"><b>Why is Tower Avenue so Dangerous?</i></b></p>
        
       <p>Continuing on the Injury and Figure 3 discussion, we must also understand why Tower Avenue has such a high number of fatal and suspected serious injuries despite being the 15th longest corridor we looked at. This is because when you see an aerial view of Tower Avenue, you will see that the corridor is mostly straight with little public transportation, shops, and crosswalks. Compare this to other corridors like Main Street and Park Street, roads that are curvy with multiple public transportation stops, crosswalks, and shops, and we can understand why more people tend to speed and drive recklessly on Tower Avenue compared to other corridors. We can then use these aerial views and the data to find similar roads to Tower Avenue and identify other problematic roads. For reference, see Figure 4 below.<p>  
        
         <img src="Hartford Map 2 Streets.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
      
         <p>Figure 4: This image shows the difference between Tower Avenue, the red corridor with the yellow marker, vs Main Street, the white corridor with the blue marker. This visual shows that Main Street has many more curves and turns compared to Tower Avenue.</p>

<p class="lead"><b>Limitations with the Data</i></b></p>

<p>While these insights are fantastic to find, there is many limitations with the data. The first being that we only had access to 783 crashes reported in 2018. This would have affected the point made in the COVID-19 section since it was signifigantly lower than the crashes reported in the subsequent years and was therefore excluded.
