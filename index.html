          <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <p class="lead"><b>Major and fatal car crashes occur frequently every day across the United States.</b></p>
          
          <p>Speeding and reckless driving is not a new issue to Hartford: as the data in Ed Stannard's <a href='https://www.courant.com/2022/07/18/here-are-10-hartford-roads-with-the-most-crashes-since-2020-with-a-map-that-shows-worst-spots/'>article</a> finds that from January 2020 to July 2022, there were 614 crashes in 10 specified Hartford corridors, including 6 fatalities.<p> 
          <p>The article states reasons for crashes that are not unique to Hartford like, "human error, distracted drivers and non-motorists, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, speeding, and otherwise just not following the rules of the road (running stop signs, driving aggressively, not yielding to pedestrians or right-of way traffic, etc.)” (<a href='https://www.courant.com/2022/07/18/here-are-10-hartford-roads-with-the-most-crashes-since-2020-with-a-map-that-shows-worst-spots/'>Stannard, Ed 4</a>).<p>  
          
          <p> Given reasons that are not caused by infrastructure, we still located the most dangerous corridors within Hartford, and attempted to determine causality of crashes.</p>
          
          <p>To Trinity students, this issue is important on a personal level because just last Spring a student died from reckless driving along a Hartford corridor.</p>
          
          <p>This type of danger should not be in the minds of Trinity students or any one else in Hartford. This is why it is important to find the most dangerous Hartford corridors to eventually find solutions to remedy the danger they pose.</p>
          
          <p class="lead"><b>What is a <i>corridor</i></b>?</p>
            
            <p>Simply put, a corridor is street, road, or avenue. In order to quantify the danger found in Hartford corridors, we had to view databases that contain Hartford crash data. The most helpful one we found was 2018-2022 Hartford police report crash data from the <a href='https://www.ctcrash.uconn.edu/'>UCONN Crash Data Repository</a>. Our data and subsequent visualization and interpretation is based on crashes taking place on their respective road, and other associated data like conditions and injury type.
              
              <p>It is worth noting that we did not include any non-local corridors such as interstates because interstate issues are not something that the city of Hartford has a large influence in, and would skew our data.</p> 
          <p>We also chose not to look at specific corridor intersections as it would likely skew our data and/or make crashes non-ascribable to a particular corridor. An analysis of intersection crashes in Hartford can be found <a href="https://jessmcruz.github.io/ints-crash-data-story/">here</a> by Jess Cruz and Mia Rodriguez.</p>

          <h2>Crashes on Hartford Corridors and Normalizing by Length</h2>
           <p class="lead"><b>So... which Hartford corridor has the most crashes?</b></p>
          <p><b>It's Main Street</b>.</p>
          
          <p>As seen in Figure 1, Main Street in Hartford has the most crashes out of any street with 1,151.</p>

         <iframe title="Total Crashes on Hartford Corridors" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-vd4kF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vd4kF/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="590" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

        <p><b>Figure 1</b>: <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/66ize/">This chart</a> shows that Main Street has the highest number of crashes out of Hartford corridors with 1,151</p>
          
        <p class="lead"><b>But is Main street the most dangerous?</b></p>
          
          <p>To answer that question we need to put our data into context.</p>
        <p>You might expect a street called <i>Main street</i> to be an important and long street. And in Hartford's case, you're right.<p> 
        <p>In order to adjust for this, we must <i><b>normalize</b></i> the data by corridor length (in miles). By normalizing the data, we mean to take the data and “adjust raw counts into relative rates, such as percentages or per capita," but in this case relative to <b>length</b> (<a href='https://handsondataviz.org/normalize.html'>Hands-On Data Visualization, Chapter 5: Normalize the Data</a>).

          
          <p>As we build our model throughout this study, we must acknowledge that "It’s unrealistic to pretend that we can create a perfect model. But we can certainly come up with a <i>good enough one</i>" (<a href='https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Truthful_Art/8dKKCwAAQBAJ'>Alberto Cairo, 2016</a>).</p>
          
          <p>Once we normalize our corridors for length, something is immediately apparent:</p>
        <p> As shown in Figure 2, <b>Park Street</b> has the most crashes per mile.</p>
          
         <iframe title="Park Street Has the Most Crashes Per Mile in Hartford" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-cwL28" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cwL28/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="590" data-external="1"></iframe>

          </script>
        
<p><b>Figure 2</b>: <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/AQ7R4/"> This chart</a> shows that Park Street has the highest number of crashes per mile with 368.</p>

          <h2>Types of Injury on Hartford Corridors</h2>
          <p class="lead">How many injuries (and what type) happen on Hartford Corridors?</p>
          
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, the makeup of injury types in Hartford corridors look <i>somewhat</i> uniform, with some corridors leading others.</p>
          
           <iframe title="Percentages of Injury Type in Crashes on Hartford Corridors" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-JAWV0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JAWV0/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="601" data-external="1"></iframe>

          </script>
        
<p><b>Figure 3</b>: <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/JAWV0/"> This chart</a> shows injury makeup percentages caused from Hartford crashes.</p>

<p>The leading corridors of each type of injury are:</p>
<p><b>Possible</b>: <i>New Park Ave</i> (67%; 32 total)</p>
<p><b>Suspected Minor</b>: <i>Farmington Ave and Granby Street</i> (54%; 59 and 13 total, respectively)</p>
<p><b>Suspected Serious</b>: <i>Tower Ave</i> (11%; 8 total)</p>
<p><b>Fatal</b>: <i>Tower Ave</i> (2.7%; 2 total)</p>

<p>Main Street and Park Street, the leaders in total crashes and crashes per mile respectively, are not leaders in an injury type. Yet, Tower Ave leads both categories of Suspected Serious and Fatal Injuries.</p>

<p>With our insights, we can ask questions like, "is there something different about Tower Ave that explains why crashes reported there have higher rates of fatal or serious injuries?"</p>
<p>This is a question worth asking because although <i>many</i> crashes occur on longer streets, long streets may be much harder to prevent dangerous crashes on due to their seemingly "<i>normal</i>" injury correlation.</p>
  
  <p>However, when there is an apparent anomaly of the serious injuries and deaths occuring on Tower Ave, we are in a position to find out why.</p>

          <h2>Causations and Limitations</h2>
         
          <p class="lead"><b>Why is Tower Avenue so Dangerous?</i></b></p>
        
       <p>Continuing on the Injury and Figure 3 discussion, we must also understand why Tower Avenue has such a high number of fatal and suspected serious injuries despite being the 15th longest corridor we looked at. This is because when you see an aerial view of Tower Avenue, you will see that the corridor is mostly straight with little public transportation, shops, and crosswalks. Compare this to other corridors like Main Street and Park Street, roads that are curvy with multiple public transportation stops, crosswalks, and shops, and we can understand why more people tend to speed and drive recklessly on Tower Avenue compared to other corridors. We can then use these aerial views and the data to find similar roads to Tower Avenue and identify other problematic roads. For reference, see Figure 4 below.<p>  
        
         <img src="Hartford Map 2 Streets.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
      
         <p>Figure 4: This image shows the difference between Tower Avenue, the red corridor with the yellow marker, vs Main Street, the white corridor with the blue marker. This visual shows that Main Street has many more curves and turns compared to Tower Avenue.</p>
          
          
<p class="lead"><b>Limitations with the Data</i></b></p>

<p>While these insights are fantastic to find, there are many limitations with the data. It was mentioned earlier that the data used in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/66ize/">Figure 1</a>, <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/AQ7R4/"> Figure 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/YaAYj/"> Figure 3</a>  was taken from 2018-2022 Hartford police report crash data from the UCONN Crash Data Repository. It can not be stressed enough that <b>police officers</b> are reporting these crashes because police officers are not perfect and reporting these crashes is difficult. What makes a minor injury vs a serious injury is very subjective, which could skew the data we have avaliable to us.<p>
  
  <p>From the data, police officers have to list over 30 observations, like Manner of Crash and Road Surface Condition, as well as the categories we mentioned above which is a multitude of observations to keep track of. Even though police officers are trained in the same way, it is very possible that not every accident was reported in the same manner and so the data and visualizations could be different if one police officer reported a crash over another.<p> 
    
    <p>The way we collected this data is another area of limitation. We collected our data in a similar manner to our <a href="https://jessmcruz.github.io/ints-crash-data-story/">intersection counterparts</a>. We first used our data from the UCONN Data Repository and downloaded it as a CSV file before uploading it into <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">Mapshaper.org</a>. From there, we used the “console” tab and typed “-points x=Longitude y=Latitude” pressed enter and then typed “-proj wgs84” to make the data into the shape of Hartford. Each dot represented where a crash occured and now we can get a better understanding of the corridors with the most corridors as a starting point.<p> 
      
      <p class="lead"><b>The COVID-19 Pandemic</i></b></p>
      
      <p>First and foremost, it is important to mention the effect that COVID had on the Hartford community. From the middle of March, about March 15, 2020 when government lockdowns were mandatory, there were 5,528 crashes reported in 2020, 5,448 crashes reported in 2021, and 5,294 crashes reported in 2022. This is a sharp decline from the 6,178 crashes reported in 2019.<p>

        <p>Keen readers might notice that 2018 was ommited from this observation and that was a result of the limitations of our data. From our data, there were only 783 crashes reported in 2018 which does not make sense. Therefore, it was ommited from our finding from above because of how signifigantly low 2018's crash numbers were compared to the subsequent years.<p>
        
      <p>Since more people were staying inside because of the government enforced lockdowns, it should come as no surprise that there were less crashes reported. However, this does skew our data as we will never know if the number of crashes had decreased because of increased safety measures by the city planners or because the lockdowns forced people to drive when it was only necessary.<p>
